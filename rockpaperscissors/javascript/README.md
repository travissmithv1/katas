# Rock Paper Scissors Kata

The game of Rock-Paper-Scissors is simple: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock.

Your task is to create the core logic that checks which gesture wins in a matchup. For example:

| Gesture 1 | Gesture 2 | Result              |
| --------- | --------- | ------------------- |
| rock      | scissors  | rock beats scissors |
| paper     | rock      | paper beats rock    |

... and so on. Good luck!
